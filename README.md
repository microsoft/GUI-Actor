Figure 1. **Left**:¬†Model performance vs. training data scale on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Higher and more left is better; larger points indicate models with more parameters. We only show GUI-Actor models built upon Qwen2-VL here for fair comparison. With Qwen2.5-VL as the backbone, GUI-Actor-3B/7B reaches scores up to 42.2/44.6 (without Verifier).¬†**Right**:¬†Illustration of action attention. GUI-Actor grounds target elements by attending to the most relevant visual regions.

## :sparkles: Highlights
ü§î **We identify several limitations in coordinate-generation based methods** (_i.e._, output screen positions as text tokens x=‚Ä¶, y=‚Ä¶) for GUI grounding, including (1) weak spatial-semantic alignment, (2) ambiguous supervision signals, and (3) granularity mismatch between vision and action space.

üí° **Rethink how humans interact with digital interfaces**: humans do NOT calculate precise screen coordinates before acting‚Äîthey perceive the target element and interact with it directly.

üöÄ **We propose _GUI-Actor_, a VLM enhanced by an action head, to mitigate the above limitations.** The attention-based action head not only enables GUI-Actor to perform coordinate-free GUI grounding that more closely aligns with human behavior, but also can generate multiple candidate regions in a single forward pass, offering flexibility for downstream modules such as search strategies.

‚ûï **We design a _grounding verifier_ to evaluate and select the most plausible action region** among the candidates proposed from the action attention map. We show that this verifier can be easily integrated with other grounding methods for a further performance boost.

üéØ **GUI-Actor achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks** with the same Qwen2-VL backbone, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on **ScreenSpot-Pro**, achieving scores of **40.7** with Qwen2-VL and **44.6** with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones.
